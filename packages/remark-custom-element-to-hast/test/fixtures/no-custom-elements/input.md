# Hello

This is a simple markdown file.

Aligned to the left      | Centered  | Table header 3
:------------------------|:---------:|--------------:
With a boring cell       | Hey       | 42
Another cell             | Wassup    | 9000

> Why not a blockquote which contain some words in **Bold** and some others in _italic_. Maybe even some simple html like <em>like one</em>.

<em>hey</em>

# This file is boring

I can think of a few reasons why this file is boring:

1. The content is dull
2. I can be playing on my playstation right now
3. I can see that even the author is bored just by reading these few lines
4. Where are all the cool custom elements/jsx ?

# Suggestions

Here are a few things I suggest to improve this file:

* A lorem ipsum would have sufficed
* Add some ponies or something
* Maybe some cats, dogs and unicorns too
* And a few other ponies

<Note>This custom element wouldn't be parsed</Note>
<my-custom-element>Not event this one</my-custom-element>
